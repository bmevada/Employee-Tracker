# Employee-Tracker
Week 12: SQL Challenge

## Background

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. A command-line application has been built from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
